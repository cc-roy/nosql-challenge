# nosql-challenge

Within this repo, the resrouces directory contains the json file that serves as the basis of the NoSQL database.

The NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb file contains code that serves to create the data base and notebook, as well as add a new document entry to the data base.

The NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb file serves as an exploratory analysis of the data produced in the setup file.
